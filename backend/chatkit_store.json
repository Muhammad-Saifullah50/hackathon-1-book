            "text": "Quaternions are a mathematical way to represent rotations in 3D space, typically expressed as a set of four values (x, y, z, w). In robotics, and particularly in ROS 2, they are used instead of simpler Euler angles (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) primarily to avoid a problem known as \"Gimbal Lock.\"\n\n**Why are they used?**\n\n*   **Avoiding Gimbal Lock:** This is the most crucial reason. Gimbal Lock occurs when two of the three rotation axes in a system of Euler angles become aligned, effectively losing a degree of freedom. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and difficulties in controlling rotations. Quaternions elegantly solve this issue by providing a more robust way to represent orientations without these singularities.\n\nYou rarely need to calculate quaternions manually, as ROS 2 libraries like `tf2_ros` and `tf2_geometry_msgs` handle the complex math for you behind the scenes when dealing with robot transformations and orientations.\n\nThis information is derived from the [Anatomy of a Humanoid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_y_S_d-P-Xj-t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m_t_z_m/edit#heading=h.gjf6p8q7e7g) section of the textbook.",
