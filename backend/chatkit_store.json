            "text": "The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture is an advanced paradigm in robotics that integrates a robot's ability to perceive its environment (vision), comprehend instructions and contexts (language), and perform physical tasks (action). Its primary goal is to develop highly intelligent and adaptable robots capable of understanding and executing complex commands.\n\nIn a VLA model, sensory input from a microphone or camera is processed by the VLA model, which often incorporates components like Whisper (for speech recognition), large language models (LLMs) for understanding and planning, and Vision AI for visual perception. This processing leads to the generation of robot actions, often in the form of structured JSON commands. These commands are then sent to a ROS 2 Action Server for the robot's physical execution.\n\nModule 4, \"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models,\" delves into several key aspects of this architecture, including:\n*   Understanding the role of LLMs in robotic task planning.\n*   Designing system prompts to guide LLMs to output structured JSON for robot control.\n*   Grasping the fundamental concepts of VLA architectures.\n*   Implementing a ROS 2 \"Planner Node\" that facilitates the interface with an LLM.\n\nSource: [Cognitive Planning (The Brain)](https://www.hello-robot.com/create/cognitive-planning)",
