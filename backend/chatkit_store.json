It's designed to facilitate the development of complex robotic applications.\n\nHere are some core concepts of ROS 2, as described in \"The Robotic Nervous System\" lesson:\n\n*   **Real-time capability (DDS):** ROS 2 utilizes the Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication. This is crucial because DDS provides reliable and real-time data exchange, which is essential for safety-critical robotic systems.\n*   **Industry Standard:** ROS 2 is widely adopted across the robotics industry, used by major organizations like NASA and Boston Dynamics, as well as numerous startups. This widespread adoption means a large community and a wealth of resources and packages are available.\n*   **Python Support:** ROS 2 offers first-class support for Python through its `rclpy` client library. This makes it very accessible for rapid prototyping and development, allowing engineers and researchers to quickly implement and test their ideas.\n\nYou can visualize the \"ROS Graph\" to understand how different components interact. This graph includes:\n\n*   **Nodes:** These are individual executable processes that perform specific tasks (e.g., a node for reading sensor data, another for controlling motors).\n*   **Topics:** Nodes communicate by publishing messages to and subscribing to messages from topics. This is a many-to-many communication mechanism.\n*   **Services:** Services provide a request/response communication pattern between nodes, useful for calling specific functions or obtaining data.\n*   **Actions:** Actions are similar to services but are designed for long-running tasks that can be preempted and provide periodic feedback.\n\n[The Robotic Nervous System](https://nurl.to/vx3a4v/) delves deeper into these concepts, including how to write a Python agent (`rclpy`) that publishes a heartbeat and how to use Launch files to orchestrate multiple nodes.",
