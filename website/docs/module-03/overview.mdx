# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain

Welcome to Module 3! This module focuses on mastering advanced perception, simulation, and navigation using the NVIDIA Isaac Platform, including Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

## Curriculum

1.  **[Photorealistic Simulation (Isaac Sim)](./01-isaac-sim-setup)**: Explore NVIDIA Omniverse, USD, and synthetic data generation.
2.  **[Hardware-Accelerated Perception (Isaac ROS)](./02-isaac-ros-gems)**: Dive into Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nvblox, and integration with Nav2 on Jetson.
3.  **[Capstone: The Perception Pipeline](./03-capstone-perception)**: Build a "Follower Robot" simulation in Isaac Sim.

## Goals

*   Understand the power of NVIDIA Isaac Sim for high-fidelity simulation and synthetic data generation.
*   Learn about hardware-accelerated perception on NVIDIA Jetson using Isaac ROS.
*   Integrate Isaac ROS with the ROS 2 Nav2 stack for advanced robot navigation.
*   Develop a full perception pipeline from simulation to robot control.
