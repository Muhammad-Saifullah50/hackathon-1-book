# Module 2: The Digital Twin

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we will explore how to create digital twins of robots and their environments using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering.

## Curriculum

1.  **[The Physics Engine (Gazebo)](01-gazebo-physics)**: Learn the fundamentals of Gazebo, URDF/SDF, and sensor simulation.
2.  **[High-Fidelity Rendering (Unity)](02-unity-integration)**: Discover how to integrate ROS 2 with Unity for advanced visualizations.
3.  **[Capstone: The Virtual Obstacle Course](03-capstone-digital-twin)**: Build a complete simulated environment and equip your robot with virtual sensors.

## Goals

*   Understand the principles of robot simulation using Gazebo and Unity.
*   Master advanced URDF/SDF concepts for realistic robot modeling.
*   Integrate ROS 2 with Unity for enhanced visualization and interaction.
