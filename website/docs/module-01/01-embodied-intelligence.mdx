# The Awakening: The Era of Embodied Intelligence

<HeroBox title="Why does a robot need to see?" variant="blue">
  <p>
    Welcome to the frontier of <strong>Physical AI</strong>. We are leaving the safe, infinite world of software for the unforgiving, gravity-bound reality of hardware. Here, there is no "undo" button for a broken motor.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Distinguish between "Digital AI" (LLMs) and "Physical AI" (Robotics).
-   Explain the "Sense -> Think -> Act" loop.
-   Identify the "Three Brains" architecture required for modern humanoid robotics.
-   Understand the cost and complexity implications of building a home robotics lab.

## 1. Introduction: Digital vs. Physical AI

Artificial Intelligence is moving from screens to the physical world. While "Digital AI" like ChatGPT lives on servers and processes text or images, **Physical AI** must interact with the real world.

### The Physics Limit

In software, you can simulate a thousand outcomes in a second. In robotics, you are bound by the laws of physics:

*   **Gravity:** Your robot will fall if not balanced.
*   **Friction:** Wheels slip, joints bind.
*   **Energy:** Batteries die, unlike wall-powered servers.
*   **Time:** Real-time means *now*, not "when the request finishes."

### The Loop: Sense -> Think -> Act

Every robot operates on a fundamental cycle:

1.  **Sense**: Gather data from the world (Cameras, LiDAR).
2.  **Think**: Process data to decide on an action (Planning, Control).
3.  **Act**: Execute the decision (Motors, Hydraulics).

## 2. Hardware Reality Check: The "Three Brains"

Modern humanoid robotics relies on a distributed architecture we call the "Three Brains".

### 1. The Simulator (God Mode)
**Hardware:** High-Performance Workstation (e.g., RTX 4070 Ti+).
This is where you train your AI. In simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim), you can run millions of training steps without breaking hardware. This requires massive parallel compute.

### 2. The Edge Brain (Inference)
**Hardware:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano/NX.
This is the computer *inside* the robot. It runs the trained models in real-time. It must be power-efficient and fast.

### 3. The Body (Actuation)
**Hardware:** Unitree Go2 or G1 Humanoid.
The physical structure, motors, and sensors.

## 3. The Senses: How Robots "Feel"

Just as we need eyes and ears, robots need sensor systems to understand their environment.

### LiDAR: Laser Eyes
Light Detection and Ranging. LiDAR spins a laser to create a 360-degree map of points (a Point Cloud). It is precise but often colorless.

### Depth Cameras: RGB + D
Devices like the Intel RealSense provide both color (RGB) and Distance (D). This allows the robot to recognize objects ("That is a cup") and know how far away they are ("It is 1.5 meters away").

### IMU: The Inner Ear
The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contains accelerometers and gyroscopes. It tells the robot:
*   "Am I falling?" (Orientation)
*   "How fast am I turning?" (Angular Velocity)

For humanoids, the IMU is critical for balance.

### Proprioception
Force and torque sensors in the joints allow the robot to "feel" the ground and the resistance of objects.

**Next:** Now that we understand the hardware, let's explore the software nervous system that connects it all: **ROS 2**.
