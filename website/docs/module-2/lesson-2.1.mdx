# Gazebo & Physics

## Concepts: Setting up the "Matrix" for robots. Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF
## Physics: Simulating gravity, collisions, and inertia. Why models fail in real life if simulation physics are wrong
## Project: Create a URDF model of a simple biped robot and spawn it in a Gazebo environment.
