## Assignment: The "Butler Bot" Simulation

**Goal:** Create a simulated humanoid robot ("Butler Bot") that can understand a natural language command, plan a sequence of actions, and execute them in a simulated environment to achieve a goal.

### Scenario

Imagine your humanoid robot in a simulated apartment environment. A user gives a high-level command. Your robot must process this command and perform the necessary steps.

1.  **Environment**: A simulated apartment in Isaac Sim or Gazebo (choose your preferred simulator). This environment should contain multiple rooms (e.g., kitchen, living room) and various objects (e.g., a red apple, a cup).
2.  **Input**: The user speaks a command, for example:
    *   "Go to the kitchen and find the red apple."
    *   "Bring me the coffee from the table."
    *   "Clean up the trash in the living room."
3.  **Process**:
    *   **`Voice Node`**: Captures the audio and transcribes the command into a text string (using Whisper).
    *   **`Planner Node`**: Receives the text command, uses an LLM to parse the intent, identifies key entities (e.g., "Kitchen," "Red Apple"), and translates them into a sequence of specific robot actions (JSON commands).
    *   **`Nav Node`**: Receives navigation actions (e.g., "go_to(kitchen)") and safely navigates the robot to the specified zone.
    *   **`Vision Node`**: Receives perception actions (e.g., "find(red_apple)") and uses simulated vision (e.g., camera data from Isaac Sim) to identify and locate the target object.
    *   **(Optional) `Manipulation Node`**: If the command involves grasping, this node executes the necessary inverse kinematics and gripper commands.

### Deliverable

A video recording (2-3 minutes) of your "Butler Bot" successfully performing at least one complex natural language command within the simulated environment. The video should demonstrate the robot's perception, planning, and execution capabilities.

### Assessment Rubric

Your "Butler Bot" simulation will be assessed on the following criteria:

*   **Functional Correctness (50 pts)**:
    *   Does the robot successfully reach the target location(s)?
    *   Does it interact with objects as intended (e.g., identifying the correct object)?
    *   Does it avoid obstacles and navigate safely?
*   **Cognitive Planning (25 pts)**:
    *   Did the `Planner Node` correctly parse the human intent and generate an appropriate sequence of robot actions (JSON commands)?
    *   Is the LLM's prompt engineering robust enough to handle variations in natural language?
*   **Code Quality & Modularity (25 pts)**:
    *   Are the ROS 2 nodes well-structured, modular, and adhere to best practices?
    *   Is the code readable, maintainable, and adequately commented?
