# The NVIDIA Isaac Platform

## Concept: Using Isaac Sim for photorealistic synthetic data generation
## Tooling: Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and Nav2 for path planning
## Requirement: Explicitly mention the hardware requirement (RTX 4070 Ti+) for running these simulations
## Project: Train a perception model to identify obstacles in Isaac Sim.
