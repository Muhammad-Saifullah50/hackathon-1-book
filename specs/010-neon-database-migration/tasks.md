# Tasks: Neon Database Migration with Better Auth

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-neon-database-migration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

**Tests**: TDD required per constitution - tests must be written first for JWT validation, DB connection, auth flows.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Deployment Model**: Separate deployments (Docusaurus static, Express auth-server, FastAPI backend)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `website/src/`
- **Auth Server**: `auth-server/src/`
- **Scripts**: `scripts/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and structure for all three deployments

- [x] T001 Create auth-server directory structure per plan.md (`auth-server/src/`, `auth-server/package.json`, `auth-server/tsconfig.json`)
- [x] T002 [P] Initialize auth-server Node.js project with dependencies (express, better-auth, pg, dotenv) in `auth-server/package.json`
- [x] T003 [P] Add backend Python dependencies (PyJWT[crypto], psycopg2-binary) to `backend/requirements.txt`
- [x] T004 [P] Add frontend client dependencies (better-auth client) to `website/package.json`
- [x] T005 [P] Create environment template files (`backend/.env.example`, `auth-server/.env.example`, `website/.env.example`)
- [x] T006 [P] Configure TypeScript for auth-server in `auth-server/tsconfig.json`

**Checkpoint**: FastAPI correctly validates JWT, returns 401 for invalid tokens, extracts user_id from valid tokens

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - User Profile Operations (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Authenticated users can create, read, and update their profiles in Neon

**Independent Test**: Create profile, retrieve it, update fields, verify all changes persist

### Tests for User Story 5

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Database) → Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (Registration) → Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US3 (Login) → Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US4 (JWT Validation) → Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US5 (Profile) → Depends on US4 (needs JWT validation working)
  - US6 (Migration) → Can start after US1 (needs Neon connection verified)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all P1 user stories being complete

```

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD required)
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- US1, US2, US3, US4 can all start in parallel after Foundational
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After Setup complete, launch foundational tasks in parallel:
Task T012: "Configure CORS in auth-server"
Task T013: "Configure JWT plugin with RS256"
Task T014: "Create database connection service in backend"
Task T015: "Create JWT validation service in backend"
Task T016: "Create auth dependency for FastAPI"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (Profile)

```bash
# Launch all tests for US5 together:
Task T055: "Contract test for GET /api/profile"
Task T056: "Contract test for POST /api/profile"
Task T057: "Contract test for PUT /api/profile"
Task T058: "Integration test for profile CRUD flow"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 - Database Connection
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 - Registration
5. Complete Phase 5: US3 - Login
6. Complete Phase 6: US4 - JWT Validation
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
8. Deploy/demo if ready (MVP!)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Database) → Test independently → ✓
3. Add US2 (Registration) → Test independently → ✓
4. Add US3 (Login) → Test independently → ✓
5. Add US4 (JWT) → Test independently → ✓ (MVP Complete!)
6. Add US5 (Profile) → Test independently → ✓
7. Add US6 (Migration) → Test independently → ✓
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 (Database) → US6 (Migration)
   - Developer B: US2 (Registration) + US3 (Login)
   - Developer C: US4 (JWT) → US5 (Profile)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

| 9 | Polish | - | 8 |
| **Total** | | | **84** |

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-6 (US1-US4) = 44 tasks
**Full Scope**: All phases = 84 tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD required: Write tests first, verify they fail, then implement
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Separate deployments: Docusaurus (static), auth-server (Express), backend (FastAPI)
